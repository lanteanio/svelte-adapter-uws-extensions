/**
 * SSRF-defence URL validator. Server-side handlers that fetch a
 * user-supplied URL (an outbound webhook, a link-preview, an avatar import)
 * are a server-side request forgery target: an attacker submits a URL
 * pointing at the cloud instance-metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`), a
 * loopback admin panel, or an RFC1918 service, and the server fetches it
 * from inside the trust boundary. `isSafeUrl` answers "is it safe to fetch
 * this URL" with a single boolean.
 *
 * Pure logic, no `node:dns` import: the synchronous `isSafeUrl` / `checkUrl`
 * classify the literal host (numeric IPs in any encoding are normalised and
 * range-checked; DNS names are classified on their literal text only). The
 * async `checkUrlResolved` takes a caller-supplied resolver to close the
 * DNS-rebinding gap.
 *
 * Blocked: loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `localhost`), link-local IPv4
 * (`169.254.0.0/16`), cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`, `fd00:ec2::254`,
 * `metadata.google.internal`), RFC1918 (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`),
 * unspecified (`0.0.0.0/8`, `::`), IPv6 ULA (`fc00::/7`), IPv6 link-local
 * (`fe80::/10`), and IPv4-mapped/compatible IPv6 forms (unwrapped to the
 * embedded IPv4). Non-http(s) schemes are rejected in every mode.
 * IP-obfuscation evasions (decimal / octal / hex / short-form IPv4,
 * IPv4-mapped IPv6, userinfo smuggling, trailing-dot, case) are normalised
 * before matching.
